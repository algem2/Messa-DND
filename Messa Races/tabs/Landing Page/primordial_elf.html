    <h2>Primordial Elf: The Sovereigns of Dawn</h2>
    <p>A primordial race gifted with the essence of magic itself. Natural born of Dawn, they are peaceful and they follow the natural order of life and fate.</p>

    <h3>Racial Traits: (Passive)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> You can choose to increase your Charisma, Wisdom, or Intelligence to 6. Your Dexterity is increased by 2. And all other skills are increased by 1 (Max 30). When rolling for ability scores, you can choose the Primordial Die (6d20).</li>
      <li><strong>Dawn Essence:</strong> You are resistant against radiant and necrotic damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Age:</strong> You are immune to aging.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elves love magic, art, music, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos (Chaotic).</li>
      <li><strong>Size:</strong> Elves range from under 6 to over 7 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</li>
      <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet.</li>
      <li><strong>Elven Ancestry:</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>
      <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Nephilic, Primordial Elven.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Racial Features: (Passive)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primordial Essence:</strong> You gain primordial essence equal to your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier. You can use primordial essence for your racial abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Darkvision:</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
      <li><strong>Magical Knowledge:</strong> You can use <em>detect magic</em> at will.</li>
      <li><strong>Elf Weapon Training:</strong> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</li>
      <li><strong>Cantrip:</strong> You can pick two cantrips from the Wizard or Sorcerer spell lists.</li>
      <li><strong>Dawn Blessing:</strong> When you roll a d20, you may roll again, and choose which result to use. You cannot do this on the same roll you've already used this trait for, and you can only do this twice, regaining both uses after finishing a long rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
      <li><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</li>
      <li><strong>Trance:</strong> Elves do not sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.</li>
      <li><strong>Starlight Step:</strong> As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Feats: Primordial Elf Abilities</h3>
    <p>You can choose these when you reach the following levels: 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th, or you may choose ability modifiers or vanilla feats. Never all of them at once.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gift of Dawn (Prerequisite: Primordial Elf, 4th level):</strong> Roll a 1d4 for each spell slot level you have access to. The result of each roll is the number of additional spell slots you gain for that spell level. These bonus spell slots are temporary and last until you finish your next long rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Dawnbound Arcanum (Prerequisite: Primordial Elf, 6th level):</strong> You tap into the primordial magic of dawn. Choose one spell from the Sorcerer or Wizard spell list of 2nd level or lower. You can cast this spell once per long rest without expending a spell slot.</li>
      <li><strong>Magic Absorption (Prerequisite: Primordial Elf, 8th level):</strong> When you are hit with elemental damage that is magical, you can use your reaction and spend 1 primordial essence to half the damage and become resistant to that element for one minute.</li>
      <li><strong>Dawn's Protection (Prerequisite: Primordial Elf, 6th level):</strong> As a reaction, when you or an ally within 30 feet takes damage, you can expend 1 primordial essence to create a protective barrier that reduces the damage taken by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier. The shield lasts until the start of your next turn.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethereal Surge (Prerequisite: Primordial Elf, 12th level):</strong> When you cast a spell that is of 6th level or below, you can spend 1 primordial essence and roll a d10 die. The die determines what Ethereal Surge effect activates:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>1-3: Empowered Spell. Add both your Intelligence and Charisma modifiers to the damage dealt if the spell deals damage. If the spell affects multiple targets, only one target takes this additional damage.</li>
          <li>4-6: Extended Duration. Double the duration of spells that have a duration (does not apply to instantaneous spells).</li>
          <li>7-8: Spell Rejuvenation. Roll a 1d6. You regain expended spell slots equal to the rolled number.</li>
          <li>9-10: Ethereal Mastery. The spell is cast without expending its spell slot.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
