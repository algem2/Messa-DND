            <h3>Primordial Elves: The Sovereigns of Dawn</a></h3> <!-- Link to Primordial Elf page -->
            <img src="assets/images/primordial_elf.jpg" alt="Primordial Elves" />
            <p>The Primordial Elves are one of the first creations of the Primordial Gods, born from the essence of Fate and Destiny. These elves are deeply attuned to the natural world and the flow of magic that governs all life. Their culture is centered around balance, peace, and the preservation of the natural order. Unlike most other elves, they possess an innate magical affinity that connects them to the very fabric of the universe, enabling them to wield formidable power without the need for tools or incantations.</p>
            <p>Their appearance reflects their ethereal nature: long, flowing hair that shimmers with the light of stars, and eyes that glow with the wisdom of ages. Primordial Elves live for millennia, and their cities are hidden within the most sacred and untouched parts of nature. These elves are pacifists, seeing violence as a disruption of the cosmic balance, and have an unshakable belief that all life should live in harmony.</p>
            <p>They are gifted in magic—particularly nature-based and elemental spells—and possess the ability to communicate with the world around them in ways other races cannot. Their powers also include manipulating the elements of earth, air, water, and fire, and they often use these abilities to maintain balance and prevent any entity from tipping the scale toward destruction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resistance to Radiant and Necrotic damage</li>
                <li>Immunity to Aging</li>
                <li>Magical abilities like 'Dawn Blessing' and 'Starlight Step'</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Nephilim -->
        <div class="race">
            <h3>Nephilim: The Ancient Giants</a></h3> <!-- Link to Nephilim page -->
            <img src="assets/images/nephilim.jpg" alt="Nephilim" />
            <p>The Nephilims are a race of beings who once lived in peace and harmony, but their desire for power and godhood led them down a dark path. The Nephilims were born from the whisperings of the goddess Desires, who tempted them with the promise of ascension. They are a proud and formidable race, with towering physical strength and potent magical abilities. They were originally peaceful, but their minds were corrupted by Desires, leading them to wage war against the Primordial Elves.</p>
            <p>The Nephilims are marked by their sheer physical prowess, their magic flowing through them with unparalleled intensity. However, they carry a dangerous ambition, one that drives them to constantly seek more power. Over time, they became the embodiment of the seven deadly sins, with each Nephilim bearing one of the sins bestowed by Desires. These sins give them incredible power but also carry the cost of internal struggle and torment. Despite their history, many Nephilims are fiercely loyal to their own and will do anything to protect their kin.</p>
            <p>Their appearance varies depending on their lineage, but most Nephilims possess features that set them apart from other mortals—sharp eyes, strong and athletic builds, and often marked by the Sin they bear. They are known for their resilience, their innate magical talent, and their will to fight for survival at any cost. Though their relationship with the gods is strained, the Nephilims remain a powerful force in the world, and their influence cannot be easily erased.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Incredible strength and resilience</li>
                <li>Control over the elements</li>
                <li>Immortal-like longevity</li>
            </ul>
